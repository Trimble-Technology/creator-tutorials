# Extrude mesh

**_Extrude all input faces._**

---

This node has data inputs and outputs.

This node has geometry inputs and outputs.


### Inputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Accepts a single geometry connection (unless the SHIFT key is held).

* _distance_

  * The distance input faces will be extruded by.

* _keep_

  * Sets which faces of the output primitives to keep. This can be `all` ( both the input faces as well as extruded faces and sides), `sides`, `extruded cap` (only the extruded faces), `caps` (only the input and extruded faces), or `sides & extruded cap` (the extruded sides and caps, but not the input faces).

* _flip direction_

  * Sets whether to flip the direction of the extrusion.

* _flip normals_

  * Sets whether to flip the normals of the output primitives.


### Outputs

* _points_

  * The list of points of the output primitives.

* _points.x_

  * The list of x values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.y_

  * The list of y values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.z_

  * The list of z values of the points of the output primitives.
