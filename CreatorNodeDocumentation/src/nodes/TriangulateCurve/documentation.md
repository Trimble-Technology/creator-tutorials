# Triangulate 2d path

**_Converts 2D curves into a triangulated mesh in a chosen workplane._**

---


### Inputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Accepts a single geometry connection (unless the SHIFT key is held).

* _work plane_

  * The work plane in which the triangulation will be performed in. This can be `X=0`, `Y=0`, or `Z=0`.

* _pre-flatten_

  * Flattens the input curves into the work plane defined by the _work plane_ input before triangulation.

* _library_

  * Sets the triangulation library to triangulate input curves. This can be `Poly2Tri` (quicker) or `Triangle` (slower, but offers triangle refinement and smoothing).

* _input handling_

  * Sets how the input curves are handled within the triangulation. This can be `first curve is outline, others are holes` (the first input curve is the outline and following input curves are holes within the resulting triangulation) or `all curves are outlines` (all input curves are outlines and no holes are made).

* _make convex hull_

  * Sets whether the resulting triangulation is a convex hull of the input curves or not.

* _algorithm_

  * Sets the algorithm to use for triangulation while the _library_ input is set to `Triangle`. This can be `sweepline`, `Dwyer`, or `incremental`.

* _refine_

  * Sets whether or not to manually refine the triangles in the resulting triangulation when the _library_ input is set to `Triangle`.

* _max area_

  * The maximum area of triangles in the resulting triangulation when the _library_ input is set to `Triangle` and the _refine_ input is set to `true`.

* _min angle_

  * The minimum angle of triangles in the resulting triangulation when the _library_ input is set to `Triangle` and the _refine_ input is set to `true`.

* _max angle_

  * The maximum angle of triangles in the resulting triangulation when the _library_ input is set to `Triangle` and the _refine_ input is set to `true`.

* _smoothing_

  * The amount of smoothing of triangle layout after triangulation defined between `0` and `100`.

* _inner points_

  * A list of extra internal points that will force the creation of vertices at these points.


### Outputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Output primitives.

* _points_

  * The list of points of the output primitives.

* _points.x_

  * The list of x values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.y_

  * The list of y values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.z_

  * The list of z values of the points of the output primitives.


### Note(s)



* The `first curve is outline, others are holes` setting of the _input handling_ input results in a single primitive whereas the `all curves are outlines` setting results in a primitive for each input curve.
* If the input curve is irregular and the resulting triangulate mesh results in “zero area triangles”, it is recommended to use the **clean mesh** node to fix the mesh.
* Other names for this node include: Triangulate curve, Tessellate, Mesh, and Path to mesh.
