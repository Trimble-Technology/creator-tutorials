# Loft

**_Creates lofted geometry between curves._**

---


### Inputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Accepts multiple geometry connections.

* _mode_

  * Sets the mode in which input curves are lofted. This can be `per geometry input` (which lofts between curves from each separate geometry input), `between geometry inputs` (which lofts between curves in each geometry input), or `all input curves` (which lofts every input curve regardless of geometry input).

* _loft type_

  * Sets the type of loft that the node will output. This can be `mesh` or `NURBS surface`.

* _per_

  * The number of curves that define a single loft when the _mode_ input is set to `all input curves`. Multiple lofts can be made from the same list of curves by setting this input to a multiple of the number of input curves. Setting this to `0` will loft all input curves.

* _mesh smoothness_

  * The amount of subdivision along the direction of input curves that have an order greater than `2` when the _loft type_ input is set to `mesh`.

* _weld_

  * Sets whether to weld the resulting loft or not when the _loft type_ input is set to `mesh`.

* _interpolate_

  * Sets whether to interpolate the resulting loft or not when the _loft type_ input is set to `NURBS surface`.

* _order U_

  * The order (perpendicular to the input curves) of the resulting loft when the _loft type_ input is set to `NURBS surface`.


### Outputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Output primitives.

* _points_

  * The list of points of the output primitives.

* _points.x_

  * The list of x values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.y_

  * The list of y values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.z_

  * The list of z values of the points of the output primitives.
