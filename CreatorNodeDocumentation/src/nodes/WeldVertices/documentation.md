# Weld Vertices

**_Welds overlapping polygon triangle edges based on an angle threshold._**

---


### Inputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Accepts a single geometry connection (unless the SHIFT key is held).

* _radius_

  * The radius that determines if adjacent vertices will be welded together.

* _angle threshold_

  * The minimum angle that determines if adjacent vertices will be welded together.

* _average position_

  * Sets whether to average the position of welded vertices or not.

* _nuke ghost triangles_

  * Sets whether to delete triangles with zero area (that can often occur by the weld). This is done after the weld.

* _nuke orphan points_

  * Sets whether to delete points not associated with any triangles. This is done after the weld.

* _mask_

  * The list of boolean values that defines which vertices to weld together. If empty, all vertices will be welded together.


### Outputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Output primitives.

* _points_

  * The list of points of the output primitives.

* _points.x_

  * The list of x values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.y_

  * The list of y values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.z_

  * The list of z values of the points of the output primitives.
