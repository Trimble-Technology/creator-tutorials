# Sphere

**_Creates a sphere._**

---


### Inputs

* _center_

  * The vector value that defines the center of the output sphere.

* _radius_

  * The value that defines the radius of the output sphere.

* _type_

  * Sets the type of sphere to output. This can be `ico` (an icosphere constructed from equilateral triangles), `columns & rows` (a sphere constructed from columns and rows), or `CSG` (a sphere constructed from the CSG system).

* _detail_

  * The value that defines the level of detail of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `ico`.

* _columns_

  * The value that defines the number of columns of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `column & rows` or `CSG`.

* _rows_

  * The value that defines the number of rows of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `column & rows` or `CSG`.

* _phi start_

  * The value that defines the start angle (in the same axis as the _columns_ input) of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `column & rows`.

* _phi end_

  * The value that defines the end angle (in the same axis as the _columns_ input) of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `column & rows`.

* _theta start_

  * The value that defines the start angle (in the same axis as the _rows _input) of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `column & rows`.

* _theta end_

  * The value that defines the end angle (in the same axis as the _rows _input) of the output sphere when the _type_ input is set to `column & rows`.


### Outputs

* **_geometry_**

  * Output primitives.

* _points_

  * The list of points of the output primitives.

* _points.x_

  * The list of x values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.y_

  * The list of y values of the points of the output primitives.

* _points.z_

  * The list of z values of the points of the output primitives.


### Note(s)



* When the _type_ input is set to `columns & rows`, adjusting the _phi _and _theta _start/end inputs will create domes and partial spheres.
* Other names for this node include: Icosphere, Ball, Poly sphere, and Globe.
