# Cross product

**_Performs the cross product of two vectors._**

---


#### Inputs

* _vector 1_

  * The first vector value to perform the function on.

* _vector 2_

  * The second vector value to perform the function on.

* _normalize_

  * Sets whether to normalize the resulting vector or not.

* _reverse_

  * Sets whether to reverse the direction of the resulting vector or not.


#### Outputs

* _result_

  * The cross product of the input vectors.

* _result list_

  * The list of cross products of the input vectors.


  ### Note(s)

* The cross product is the perpendicular vector of two input vectors. The size of this vector is determined by the size of the input vectors and the angle between them.
