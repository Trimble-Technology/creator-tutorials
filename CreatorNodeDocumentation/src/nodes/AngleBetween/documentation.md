# Angle between

**_Finds the (smallest) angle between two vectors._**

---


#### Inputs

* _vector 1_

  * The first vector value to find the angle from.

* _vector 2_

  * The second vector value to find the angle to.

* _output radians_

  * Sets whether to output radians (rather than degrees) or not.


#### Outputs

* _result_

  * The angle between two vectors.

* _result list_

  * The list of angles between two vectors.


### Note(s)

* Calculates the angle between two vectors from `0,0,0`. To use this node accurately be sure to have three vectors, the two to find the angle between, and one which the angle is taken from (if you know this third angle, you can transform the two vectors to `0,0,0` then perform the operation)

* Other names for this node include: Angle between vectors.
