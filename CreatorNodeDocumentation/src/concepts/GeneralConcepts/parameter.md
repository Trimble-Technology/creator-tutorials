# Parameter

---

Parameters can be considered the inputs to a [graph](/concepts/GeneralConcepts/graph.md). They are created by value type [nodes](/concepts/GeneralConcepts/node.md), tagged as parameters. They are often represented by a control in the parameter panel. For example: a slider to control a number parameter, or a color picker for a color parameter.

Consumer type users cannot modify anything other than the value of parameters within a [graph](/concepts/GeneralConcepts/graph.md).

In the graph depicted below, the "repeat image" node (which is a renamed [**number**](/nodes/FloatValue/documentation.md) node) is a parameter.
