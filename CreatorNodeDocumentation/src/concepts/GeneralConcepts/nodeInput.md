# Node Input

A node has a defined set of inputs, or input properties. Node input properties can be considered the arguments to the function that the node represents. For example: the _radius_ input of a **sphere** node. Internally this is a float value argument to the function that creates the sphere.

Node inputs can be set directly, but also by other nodes through connections.
