# Ephemeral State

Graphs have a boolean value representing their ephemeral state, and this state is exposed to graph logic through the **ephemeral** node.

The ephemeral state can, for example, be used to lower detail and compute load when a user is dragging a parameter slider in the "Parameter Panel".
