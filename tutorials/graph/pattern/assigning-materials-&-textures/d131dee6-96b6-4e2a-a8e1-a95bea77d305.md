This graph looks at assigning materials and textures to geometry.

Assigning materials is very easy in Creator, and is done using the **create material** and **apply material** node.

To assign a texture, you need to first use a **project UV** node. This will define how the texture is mapped to the geometry.

Click through each of the final **apply material** nodes in the graph to see each one in action. Try changing some of the inputs to see how the material changes.
