In this pattern we have a row of boxes and we want to set each box with a random color. To do so we will loop through each box and set a color based on the **iterator** node’s *index*.

To do so we will create a **get primitive** node from the **copy** node with our row of boxes. Connect the *value* output from the **iterator** node to the *index* input of the new **get primitive** node. This will isolate one box from the row.

Connect the **get primitive** node to the **apply material** node to set the box’s color.
