To finish off, create a connection between the **apply material** node and the **loop** node. As you will notice though, there will only be one box outputting from the **loop** node, this is because the **loop** is only running for one iteration/loop.

To supply the **loop** node with the correct number of iterations/loops, create a **# primitives** node from the original **copy** node. Then connect the *result* output from the **# primitives** node to the *# of loops* input on the **loop** node.
