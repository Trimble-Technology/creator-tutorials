To bring a little bit of life to the model, let's add some simple colors.

Create an **apply material** node from the **loop** node and create a **create material** node that connects to the _material_ input of the **apply material** node, setting the _base color_ input to `0.5,0.5,0.5`.

Then create a second **apply material** node from the **copy using vectors** node that contains the sleepers and create a **create material** node, setting the _color_ input to `0.6,0.4,0` and connecting it to the _material_ input of the **apply material**.
