For the final part of the shelf itself using a geometry connection, create an **apply material** node from the **extrude** node. Then create a **create material** node that connects to the _material_ input of the **apply material** node and set the _base color_ input to `0.7,0.6,0.4`.

And finally, to help us in the future, create a **collect** node from the **apply material** node via a geometry connection and connect that **collect** node to the final **loop** node. For now this **collect** will only have one connection so is a little redundant, but we will use it to collect up the object that will go in the hexagon in the coming steps.
