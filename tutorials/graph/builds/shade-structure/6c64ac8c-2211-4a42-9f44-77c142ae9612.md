And that’s the end of the tutorial!

We can now download our graph as a Live Component to be imported to SketchUp. First, click on the “SketchUp” icon to the left of the app. This will take you to a new tab which shows your new Live Component in a SketchUp environment.

From here you can select the “download” button in the parameter panel which will give you a .skp file containing the Live Component. All you need to do now is import it into a SketchUp file either on Desktop or Web!

Side note: If you want to, have a play around with adding your own touches to the graph. Some ideas could be adjusting the spacing between the purlins or adding a “Height” parameter.
