We will be using some pre-modeled geometry to create our graph. You will need two files: “Shade Structure Classic.trb”, and “Shade Structure Modern.trb”. Click the following links to download the files.

[Shade Structure Classic.trb](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1e-X8gAnYoE4CbOdZrq1SJEO8sAMoDPfE)

[Shade Structure Modern.trb](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1_PVFo63Ek37apnUTKDx4xj47RYTKWeAd)

To upload these files simply drag and drop them from your file viewer (or wherever you may have them stored), into the graph viewer.

Two nodes will have been made to reference these uploaded files.
