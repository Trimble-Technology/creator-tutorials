We now want to parameterize the **choice** node so that we can configure it via the “parameter panel".

As a refresher:
1. RMB-click on the **choice** node.
2. Click the “Parameter” option.

We will also change the name of the **choice** node to specify its function. To do so, zoom into the graph until the edit icon appears next to the node name. Click it and replace the text with `Type`.

Now we have a drop down in the parameter panel to control the type of Shade Structure we want.
