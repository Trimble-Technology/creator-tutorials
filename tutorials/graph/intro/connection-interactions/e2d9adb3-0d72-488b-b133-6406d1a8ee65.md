Geometry connections visualize the flow of geometry through a graph. They can be created in multiple ways.

### Method 1

Connection + node creation.

This connection method involves the creation of the target node. This method then automatically creates a geometry connection between two nodes.

1. LMB-click-drag the gradient coming out of the right (output) or left (input) side of a node.
2. Release it on empty graph space to open a “Create Node” dialog.
3. Search for the node you want to create and connect to, press ENTER.

### Method 2

Input targeted connection.

1. LMB-click-drag the gradient coming out of the right (output) side of a node.
2. Release it on top of another node.

### Method 3

Output targeted connection.

1. LMB-click-drag the gradient coming out of the left (input) side of a node.
2. Release it on top of another node.

### Method 4

Split geometry connection.

You can also create geometry connections by dragging off existing geometry connections. This will create a new active connection the same as the one that you dragged off.

1. LMB-click-drag on an existing connection.
2. Release it on top of another node.

### More than one geometry connection

Most geometry nodes can handle multiple incoming geometry connections. Some nodes, like the **Collect** node will automatically accept a second, third etc. connection. It is important to note that the order that you connect the geometry matters on nodes like this, as this will be the order that the node computes.

However most geometry nodes will replace the already existing geometry connection.

To override this behavior, and force adding a geometry connection instead of replacing the existing one, use the SHIFT key while connecting.
