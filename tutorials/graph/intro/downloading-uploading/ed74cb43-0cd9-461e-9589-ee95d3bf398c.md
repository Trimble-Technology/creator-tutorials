Downloading your graph as a Live Component to be used in SketchUp is a relatively simple process. Let's go over how this is done:

1. Click on the SketchUp icon button that is on the left hand side of the app. As seen in the image below, labeled with a **1**.

2. Doing so will open a SketchUp viewer for the graph, where we can see our graph within the SketchUp environment.

3. Click on the "Download" button at the bottom of the "Configure" panel. This will download an .SKP file.

4. Once we have our .SKP file that references our graph as a Live Component, we can then drag and drop it into a SketchUp project!


Be careful though! Opening an .SKP file that references a graph will only open the raw geometry of the previous parameter configuration. In order to properly utilize the Live Component, we must import it into a SketchUp project.
