It is easy to get geometry and images/textures into Creator.

For geometry, Creator supports the import of IGES, Wavefront OBJ, DXF, TRB and PLL files.

For images/textures, Creator supports the import of JPEG and PNG files.

To import, simply LMB-drag-drop files onto the graph viewer and wait for them to upload to the service.

1. Find the “generic-window.trb” and “victorian-window.trb” files you just downloaded.
2. Drag-drop the files onto the graph viewer.
