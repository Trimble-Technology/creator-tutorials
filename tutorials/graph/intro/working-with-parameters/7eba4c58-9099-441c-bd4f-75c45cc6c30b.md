Parameters can be enriched by applying units to them. These can be of multiple types in metric, imperial, and a variety of SI units. These are catagorized under; Length, Area, Volume, mass, and angle.

To apply a unit to a parameter we can do the following:

1. RMB-click on the **number** node in this graph.
2. Below "Parameter" (which you will by now be familiar with), is another option: "Unit".
3. Navigating to it, we can see a bunch of options pertaining to the catagories listed above.
4. By selecting an option we can apply a unit. For this example, lets go to "length" > "mm" and select it.
5. Now, if we go to the "Parameter panel" we can see that our "number" parameter now has a unit assigned to it!

It is important to note that the node does not convert the input value to the unit that the graph is set to (For example a parameter set to 1000mm will not automatically convert to 1m if the graph unit is set to meters). Instead, you will need to convert the value yourself. typically with the **multiply** node if the parameter and graph units differ.

To change the graph unit, we can similarly RMB-click on the graph's grid and set it via the "Graph length unit" option.
